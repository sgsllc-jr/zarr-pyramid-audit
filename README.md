# zarr-pyramid-audit

Read-only integrity auditing for OME-Zarr multiscale pyramids served over HTTP or S3.

Built to audit [`dl.ash2txt.org`](https://dl.ash2txt.org/) (the Vesuvius Challenge / Scroll Prize
data host), but nothing in it is Vesuvius-specific: point `--base` at any store that exposes a
directory autoindex and it works.

## The failure class this exists to find

Every consumer that is not doing full-resolution work reads a **reduced** level. Viewers navigate at
level 3–5, registration and QC run at level 2, and several published models train on a specific
level. A pyramid level that is absent, mis-declared, or generated with a different convention from
its siblings **does not raise an error anywhere** — it returns plausible-looking voxels.

That is the entire point. These defects are invisible to the tools people actually use:

- A level declared in `multiscales` but missing from the server → 404, or silently `fill_value`.
- A level with a valid `.zarray` **and no chunks at all** → reads return `fill_value` everywhere,
  no error, no warning, no way to tell it from real data without counting keys.
- A `scale` transform that contradicts the array's own shapes → coordinates off by 32× on one axis.
- Chunk files with no header → undecodable, but the directory looks populated.

Checks are **header-only by default**: a pyramid is judged from its `.zattrs` plus one `.zarray` per
level — a few KB regardless of array size — so a whole corpus can be audited without downloading it.

## Design notes worth knowing

**It does not depend on `zarr`.** Headers are parsed directly from `.zattrs` / `.zarray` /
`zarr.json`. This is deliberate: a store that `zarr.open()` refuses to open is exactly the kind of
defect the tool needs to *report*, not crash on.

**Absence is only ever inferred from positive evidence.** The chunk-presence check
(`LEVEL_NO_CHUNKS`) trusts a directory listing to prove a level is empty *only* if that listing
demonstrably shows a file already known to exist (the header just read). On a store with no
autoindex, or with dotfiles hidden, the result degrades to `unknown` and **no finding is emitted**.
A tri-state (`True` / `False` / `None`), never a boolean. This is what keeps the check portable to
the S3 mirror instead of flagging every level there.

**Read-only by construction.** The HTTP store class has no write path.

**Reproducible.** Every run writes a manifest with argv, cwd, host, platform, interpreter, package
versions, counters, and output inventory. Outputs are never silently overwritten — an existing file
is backed up to `<name>.<timestamp>.bak` first, so a partial rerun can never be mistaken for a
complete one.

**Severity is honest.** `info` codes describe what a node *is* (a bare array, a non-multiscale
group) and are never counted as defects.

## Tools

| tool | what it does | cost |
|---|---|---|
| `bin/discover_zarr.py` | Crawls a store's autoindex and finds every Zarr root. Prunes chunk trees, `.tifxyz` leaves, coordinate and segment directories — but runs a Zarr-header test *before* every prune rule, so a heuristic can never discard a real root. | listings only |
| `bin/audit_pyramid.py` | 21 check codes across the roots found above. Header-only unless `--no-chunk-presence` is off (it is on by default, adding one listing per present level). | ~KB per pyramid |
| `bin/count_chunks.py` | For a shortlist of roots: counts chunks actually present per level, `HEAD`s a sample to get stored bytes, and re-encodes a sample locally to measure a real compression ratio. Reports whether stored size is `exact` (all samples full-size) or extrapolated. | HEADs + small GETs |

### Check codes

```
NOT_A_ZARR_GROUP          [info] no .zgroup/zarr.json and nothing Zarr-like inside
BARE_ARRAY                [info] valid single-scale Zarr array; not a pyramid
NOT_MULTISCALE            [info] valid Zarr group, but not an OME pyramid
CHUNK_EXCEEDS_SHAPE       [info] chunk larger than the level itself on every axis
HEADERLESS_CHUNK_STORE    chunk keys present but no header -- undecodable
CONTAINER_NO_GROUP_HEADER children are Zarr nodes but root has no group header
EMPTY_ZARR_DIR            *.zarr directory with no contents
MULTISCALE_EMPTY          declares multiscales but yields no usable datasets
LEVEL_MISSING             declared level has no readable array header
LEVEL_NO_CHUNKS           valid header, zero chunk keys -- reads return fill_value silently
LEVEL_UNDECLARED          numeric level directory exists but is not declared
SCALE_NONMONOTONIC        declared scales do not strictly increase with depth
SCALE_SHAPE_MISMATCH      shape matches neither ceil nor floor of base/factor
MIXED_ROUNDING            ceil at some levels, floor at others
DTYPE_DRIFT / FILL_DRIFT / COMPRESSOR_DRIFT / SEPARATOR_DRIFT / NDIM_DRIFT
AXES_MISMATCH             declared axes count != array ndim
DEGENERATE_LEVEL          a level has a zero/negative extent
```

## Usage

```bash
python -m venv .venv && ./.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
./.venv/bin/python bin/discover_zarr.py --base https://dl.ash2txt.org/ --max-depth 10 --out-dir tmp
```

`--max-depth 10` is not optional for this host: the default (6) stops short of the roots under `community-uploads/bruniss/scrolls/s1/…/old/…` and `Scroll5/…/representations/predictions/fibers/`, which sit 7–8 path segments deep (a depth-6 run finds 229 roots instead of 241). Zarr **v3** stores (`zarr.json`) are not yet parsed and are reported as `NOT_A_ZARR_GROUP` (info).

```bash
./.venv/bin/python bin/audit_pyramid.py --base https://dl.ash2txt.org/ --roots tmp/discover_zarr.roots.jsonl --max-rps 25 --out-dir tmp
```

```bash
./.venv/bin/python bin/count_chunks.py --base https://dl.ash2txt.org/ --roots-csv shortlist.csv --out-dir tmp
```

Outputs land in `--out-dir`: `*.findings.csv` (the reviewable artifact), `*.levels.jsonl`,
`*.pyramids.jsonl`, `*.summary.json`, `*.manifest.json`.

**Cross-validation.** 64 of the 241 roots mirror the 64 volumes on `s3://vesuvius-challenge-open-data`,
which already has an independent auditor
([Bullo27/scroll-data-audit](https://github.com/Bullo27/scroll-data-audit)). This tool reports
**0 defects** on all 64 — the same verdict, reached with a different codebase and a different
transport. Every defect found is in the 177 roots that tool does not cover.

**Also clean across all 241:** no dtype drift, ndim drift, fill-value drift, `dimension_separator`
drift, non-monotonic scales, mixed ceil/floor rounding, or undeclared level directories.

### The sharpest single finding

`other/dev/inked_zarrs/3336_predictions.zarr` declares a 6-level pyramid, has a valid `.zarray` at
**all six** levels, and contains **zero chunk files at every one of them**. `fill_value` is `0`, so
`zarr.open()` succeeds and every read returns zeros — with no error, at any level, ever.

```bash
B=https://dl.ash2txt.org/other/dev/inked_zarrs/3336_predictions.zarr
for l in 0 1 2 3 4 5; do printf "L$l .zarray="; curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $B/$l/.zarray; printf "  chunks="; curl -s $B/$l/ | grep -c 'href="[^.]'; done
```

## Accuracy policy

Every actionable finding was re-verified with `curl` against the live server, independent of the
tool, before being reported. Storage figures from `count_chunks.py` distinguish **measured** from
**modelled**: each level records whether its stored-bytes figure is `exact` (every sampled chunk was
full size) or extrapolated, and compression ratios derived from small samples are reported as
order-of-magnitude with their sample size, not to spurious precision.
